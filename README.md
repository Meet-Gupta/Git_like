# Git_like

## Project Overview

This project is an implementation of a basic version control system, inspired by Git, written in C++. The purpose of this project is to build a foundational understanding of how version control systems like Git work internally, including features like commits, branching, staging, and repository management.

## Key Features

- Repository Creation: Initialize a new repository in any directory.
- Staging Area (Index): Add and remove files to the staging area before committing changes.
- Commit System: Track snapshots of the staged changes.
- Branching: Create and manage branches for parallel development.
- Checkout: Switch between branches or revert to specific commits.
- Log: View the history of commits.
- Diff: Compare changes between different commits or the working directory and the latest commit.
- Reset: Unstage or undo changes in the repository.
- Merge: Combine the history of two branches together.
- Conflict Resolution: Handle conflicts during merges.
- Interactive Staging: Stage specific lines or parts of a file.

## Usage

g++ -o test src/repository.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -lz
g++ src/commit.cpp src/repository.cpp -o testCommit -lssl -lcrypto -lz
